Act as a Senior React Native Engineer. We are moving to **Stage 2** of the development.
The Goal: Activate the "Real-Time Logistics Engine" for the existing UI.

**Do not delete existing screens.** Modify them to implement the following 3 critical features:

### **Feature 1: Address Geocoding (Restaurant Side)**
**Target File:** `client/screens/restaurant/CreateOrderScreen.tsx`
**Requirement:**
1.  When the Restaurant enters a text address (e.g., "Cairo Festival City"), use `expo-location` -> `Location.geocodeAsync(address)` to convert it into `{latitude, longitude}`.
2.  Store these coordinates in the `customer_geo` column in the `orders` table when submitting the form.
3.  **Fallback:** If geocoding fails, default to a placeholder location (e.g., city center) but allow the user to proceed.

### **Feature 2: Driver Live Tracking (Driver Side)**
**Target File:** `client/screens/driver/MyTasksScreen.tsx`
**Requirement:**
1.  Implement `Location.watchPositionAsync` from `expo-location`.
2.  **Logic:**
    * Start tracking ONLY when the driver status is 'Available' (you may need to add a toggle switch in the UI).
    * Update interval: Every 10 seconds or every 50 meters.
3.  **Database Sync:**
    * On every location update, send an `UPDATE` query to the `profiles` table setting the `current_location` column (use PostGIS format if enabled, or simple JSONB `{lat, lng}` depending on current schema).
    * *Optimization:* Do not await this call (fire and forget) to keep UI smooth.

### **Feature 3: The Dispatcher "God View" (Dispatcher Side)**
**Target File:** `client/screens/dispatcher/MapScreen.tsx`
**Requirement:**
1.  Connect the Map to **Supabase Realtime**.
2.  **Channel Subscription:** Subscribe to `postgres_changes` on the `profiles` table.
3.  **Visualization:**
    * When a driver moves (row update), smoothly animate or update their marker on the map.
    * Show different marker icons/colors for "Available" vs "Busy" drivers.
4.  **Orders Layer:** Fetch "Pending" orders and display them as Pins on the map (using the `customer_geo` data from Feature 1).

### **Technical Constraints:**
* Ensure `expo-location` permissions are requested correctly on app launch.
* Handle errors gracefully (e.g., if GPS is off).
* Keep using `NativeWind` for any new UI elements (like the "Go Online" switch for drivers).

**IMPLEMENT THESE FEATURES NOW.**
